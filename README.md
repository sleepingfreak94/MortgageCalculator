# Mortgage Calculator (Java)

This Java console application calculates the monthly mortgage payment using the standard amortization formula. It includes two versions:

- **MortgageCalculator.java** – Basic version without input validation.
- **MortgageCalculator_ErrorHandling.java** – Enhanced version with input validation and user-friendly prompts.

## Mortgage Formula

The calculation is based on the standard mortgage formula:

\[
M = P \times \frac{r(1 + r)^n}{(1 + r)^n - 1}
\]

Where:

- `M` = Monthly Payment
- `P` = Principal (Loan Amount)
- `r` = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100)
- `n` = Number of Payments (Years × 12)
